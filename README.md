# WinFlash âš¡

---

WinFlash is a program that runs in the background and upon insertion of a flash drive, copies all files and directories in it to a folder. 
**Note:** It takes a given amount of time depending on the read/write speed of the drives. (which means that you can't insert the flash drive in and then instantly take it out like in the movies)
